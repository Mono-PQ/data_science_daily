- Given the high cost of car ownership in Singapore, it's natural for consumers to seek brands that are reknown for it's reliability and low maintenance cost for the next 10 (or less) years before the certificate of entitlement (COE) expires. 
- With that in mind, demand for Toyota and Honda are the highest in Singapore. 
- But supplier could leverage on this competitve advantage to charge a premium in Singapore. Hence, the cost of a Toyota car have been steadily increasing over the years. The price of Toyota brand new cars come close to Mercedes Benz in recent years. But driving experience of continental car still trumps over commercial Japanese car.

**Honda**
- Observed a spike from around 48k in 2005 to 86k in 2008. Another increase observed from 86k in 2015 to 94k in 2016. 
- One possible reason for the increase in recent years may be a result from public driving center for learners use Honda jazz as their training cars.

Sales of Nissan cars have been declining especially in one of the most important market - China resulting in 9,000 jobs cut and reduced ownership stake in Mitsubishi. 
- Additionally, Nissan cars have been perceived as increasingly unreliable and appearing less on searches of reliable car brands. From auto-dealers to car instructors, the bad reviews of Nissan car especially in terms of reliability have been popping up.

#### 3 - About car make in data
Top 5 most common car make in Singapores are: Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, and Mercedes Benz. 
Bottom 5 car make in Singapores are: MayBach, Smart, Lada, Mini cooper, Bertone.

Based on intuition, there could be prolems with the data collected given that mini cooper are common in Singapore roads.
Data came from LTA and figures include cars exempted from tax and vehicle quota system. However, it's unclear about the time period of data collection. 

Does the car make only include newly and renewed issued COE cars for that year or all cars in Singapore? Perhaps, there are missing or unaccounted data that were not included in the database.
