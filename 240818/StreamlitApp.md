# [18 Aug 2024] Deploying the charts on online shoppers using streamlit 

The purpose of the project is to deploy the charts and findings of Singapore online shoppers data (2007 - 2018) from IMDA on a web application using streamlit. 

`Streamlit` is an open source python library that enables quick and easy deployment of data related works (e.g., analysis, visualisation) using the web application. This way, data scientists and analysts can share their findings with stakeholders and clients using a web link which anyone can access. 

The web application can be accessed using this <a href="https://datasciencedaily-urv35jya6ku6dnk8u8mozh.streamlit.app" target="_blank">link</a>. Data visualisation in the web application is interactive using `plotly.express` library. You can hover your cursor over the data points in the chart to view more details.
